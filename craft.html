            The style that was more responsible than any other for launching the American craft brewing scene began as a vehicle for expressing the one ingredient that truly distinguished the U.S. from the European nations where most of our classic styles originated: our hops. Big, bold American hops were unlike any varieties grown in the Old World, and first wave American craft brewers planted their flag with the expressive citrus and pine aromas of North American hops like Cascade.
            
            Sierra Nevada Pale Ale debuted in 1981 with a flavor profile no one had tasted before, with sunny grapefruit and pine snuggled into a bed of pale and caramel malt. Bold but balanced. Expressive but egalitarian. The beer came to define the centerline of American craft beer flavor as the scene developed and matured over the following decades, and pioneered a brand new style, American Pale Ale. While these beers bear resemblance to their English inspiration, the character of American hops shining alone without the (often pleasant) complications of British ale yeast makes them completely unique. In a scene sometimes obsessed with complex flavor matrices and esoteric ingredients, the deceptively simple recipe of pale malt, caramel malt, and one or more American hops, fermented with a clean ale yeast, yields a beautiful pint with various fruit aromas and flavors (depending on your chosen hops), a gently sweet caramel malt foundation, and a dry, moderately bitter finish.
            
            
           <h2> Stouts and Porters</h2>

            Stouts and Porters share a common lineage, and drinkers and even brewers can still sometimes struggle to disentangle the two style families. Let’s look at the shared ancestry of these styles.
            
            Porters were the first beers to receive the factory-esque brewery treatment of the early Industrial Revolution in England. A popular origin story claims the style’s name came from the London transportation workers who loved the brown beer, but the fact is folks from all walks of life loved it, and it’s very difficult to establish how the beer got its name. What can be established is that Porter was a big deal in late 18th century London, and, by extension, the British empire, being exported far and wide. Wherever it landed, whether relatively close to home in Dublin, Ireland, or farther afield in the Baltic states or Caribbean islands, it changed to suit the tastes and ingredients of its new home. Strong versions of the beer were referred to as “Stout Porters,” and eventually came to be known as merely Stouts.
            
            Prior to 1817, these beers were made with copious amounts of inefficient brown malts, but Daniel Wheeler’s invention that year of a drum roaster than allowed malt to be roasted very dark without being burned changed the way Porters and Stouts were brewed. New recipes were comprised primarily of efficient pale malts and judicious amounts of these new dark malts to create the color and flavors desired.
            
            Today Stouts enjoy a wider style diversity than Porters, with examples ranging from the light and dry Irish Stout to the big and heavy Imperial Stout. Porters still tend to be every-day, no-nonsense drinking beers, paying homage to their past. While brewers disagree about the primary difference between American Stout and American Porter, the general agreement is that Porters should utilize a lower amount (if any) of roasted barley or black patent malt, allowing for a mellower roast character.

            Modern Brown Ales are a 20th century development. While brown ales have been enjoyed in England since well before 1900, the modern interpretation of the style bears little resemblance to those historical beers. The current iteration of English Brown Ale is a fairly mild beer with caramel-focused malt flavor that lacks the roastiness of Porters and Stouts.
            
            American Brown Ale took inspiration from the British version, but diverges widely from its ancestor. The style gained early popularity with American homebrewers, and remains a staple of craft brewing. American Brown Ales tend to be both hoppier and roastier than the English versions, with the hoppiest versions bleeding into a style called Brown IPA, while the roastier versions are closer to being mild Porters than classic brown ales.

            Amber or Red Ale is another style that developed early in the American craft brewing movement, primarily to provide a balanced, easy-drinking option for newcomers alongside the more aggressive styles that defined this new world of flavorful beer. It gained popularity on the West Coast, and eventually became a stable of brewery tap lists across the country. You can brew your own Alaskan Amber Ale by getting our recipe kit here!
            
            The name of the style is an indication of its malt profile, which is based on simple pale malt but features medium to dark crystal malts to provide color, caramel flavor, and a moderate initial sweetness. The balance between hops and malt in this style varies widely from brewery to brewery, with maltier options showcasing that mid-level caramel character, while hoppier versions begin to edge into Pale Ale territory, with assertive American hop character. Extremely hoppy beers with this malt profile ultimately belong in the Red IPA style.
            
             
           
            
             
            
         <h2>   American Wheat & Hefeweizen</h2>

            While both American Wheat Ale and German Hefeweizen share a similar wheat-focused grain bill and so, correspondingly, a similarly lightly bready flavor profile and fluffy mouthfeel, the similarities mostly stop there. The big differences between these styles come from the yeast and hops used in each.
            
            Hefeweizen hails from Bavaria in southern Germany, and has a fascinating history stretching over centuries that we don’t have the space to get into here. Was makes it truly unique within a traditional German beer landscape mostly known for clean lager styles is its expressive yeast strain. All ales (with some exceptions within the sour and mixed-fermentation family) are fermented with the same yeast species—saccharomyces cerevisiae—but there are numerous strains that have different fermentation characteristics and generate different levels of aroma-producing esters and phenols. Hefeweizen yeast produces a lot of the ester isoamyl acetate, which comes across most commonly as banana or bubblegum, and the phenol 4vinyl-guiacol, which tastes like cloves. Because of Hefeweizen’s low hop character, these yeast notes are the defining flavors of the style.
            
            American Wheat beers (they can occasionally be lagers, but are most commonly ales) are fermented with cleaner American yeast, and don’t share their inspiration’s banana-and-clove eccentricity. Many examples make up for this with significantly higher hopping rates, showcasing fruity American hop aromas.

            Belgium is a wonderland of diverse and unique beer styles. Many of the world’s rarest and most esteemed beers come from this small country, including 6 of the world’s 12 Trappist breweries. While Belgian brewers as a group generally prefer to eschew strict style guidelines in favor of freedom of expression, the most popular Belgian beers imported to this country tend to fall into a few common styles.
            
            The most approachable of these beers is Belgian Pale Ale. Generally around 5.0-5.5% ABV, these relatively easy-drinking beers are brewed with mostly Pilsner or pale malts with small proportions of Vienna or Munich malt. Expressive Belgian ale yeast provides some noticeable fruitiness and mild spiciness, though neither is as elevated as in some other styles from this country. A graceful hand with Saaz, Styrian, or English hops allows for some subtle floral, herbal, or spicy background character.
            
            With styles like Dubbel and Tripel, we enter the prestigious world of Belgian abbey ales. These beers have their roots in the country’s monastic brewing traditions, and some of them are still brewed at monasteries (the Trappists, for example) or in conjunction with active abbeys or historical abbey preservation groups. Many, of course, are brewed without any connection to these institutions at all.
            
            One of the curious ironies of these venerated, high-gravity beers has to do with their sources of fermentable sugars. Dubbel, Tripels, and Quadrupels (which are similar to Dubbels in character but stronger) are all brewed with a good proportion of adjunct sugar, typically in the form of candi sugar or candi syrup. Yep, these hallowed brews use plain old sugar to reach their desired alcohol level without needlessly increasing the body of the beer. Dubbels and Quads can even take much of their brownish color from darker sugars.
            
            Abbey styles all showcase expressive Belgian yeast characteristics. Dubbels and Quads also showcase complex specialty malt profiles, while Tripels can often display some regal continental hop character.
            
             
          
             
        <h2>  Saison & Farmhouse Ale</h2>

            There is a tremendous amount of romance surrounding Saison and the “Farmhouse Ales” inspired by it. The popular origin story for Saison has the beer developing on 19th century farmsteads in Wallonia in southern Belgium. According to lore, farms were responsible for providing beer for the seasonal field workers who brought in the harvest, and during the winter they would brew with the ingredients they had on hand, holding the beer over till it was needed in the summer.
            
            It’s a lovely story, but unfortunately there is limited historical support for its veracity. Beer was undoubtedly brewed at farms in Belgium at the time, as it was all over Europe, but the beer we know today as Saison is most likely a twentieth century commercial creation.
            
            Nonetheless, Saisons and Farmhouse Ales have found tremendous popularity in the last few years as consumers continue to seek greater authenticity and proximity (or the appearance of such) in the production of their food and drink. The best examples are both rustic and refined, balancing expressive yeast character and moderate hopping with a dry, quenching finish.
            
            The grist for Saison is pretty simple, consisting mostly of Pilsner malt and occasionally some specialty grains to riff on the rustic, agrarian image of the style. Hopping rates with continental hops are relatively low, but the hops tend to be fairly expressive in the finished profile due to the style’s extremely low finishing gravity (in classic examples). The style’s most tell-tale attribute is its unique ale yeast strain that ferments at a higher temperature than most ale yeasts, producing peppery phenolics and surprisingly subtle esters. A related style from France known as Biere de Garde is generally maltier and fuller, with subtler yeast notes.
